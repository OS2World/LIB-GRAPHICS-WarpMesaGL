WarpMesaGL vers. alpha -1.49

Port to OS/2 PM of Mesa by Brian Paul (www.mesa3d.org)
Mesa is a 3-D multyplatform graphics library with an API which is
very similar to that of OpenGL.

"WarpMesaGL" is current work name for port of original Mesa.
The name "Mesa" in OS/2 is currently used for electronic table,
so "WarpMesaGL" is used to eliminate misunderstanding.

Original Mesa version: 5.0 (supports OpenGL 1.4)

I've cleaned up the makefiles to make them more portable.
Added a couple of scripts to clean and build. Adjust setenv.cmd for your environment and run buildall.cmd.
Only tested with VACPP 3.08
